#### what is main.ts about

The `main.ts` file is the main entry point of the software. It contains the main logic and functionality of the application. It imports various modules and defines functions and classes that are used to perform tasks such as web scraping, data processing, and interacting with the OpenAI API.

The file is responsible for initializing the Apify SDK, checking for the presence of the OpenAI API key, and retrieving input data. It also sets up a PlaywrightCrawler instance for web scraping, defines request and failed request handlers, and processes the scraped data using the OpenAI API.

The processed data is then stored in a dataset using the Apify SDK. The file also handles logging and error handling.

Overall, `main.ts` orchestrates the entire scraping and data processing workflow of the application.


#### does it downloads pdf files while web scraping  

Based on the provided code in `main.ts`, it does not appear that the application is set up to download PDF files during web scraping. The code includes a pre-navigation hook that blocks requests for certain file types, including PDFs. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```typescript
preNavigationHooks: [
    async ({ blockRequests }) => {
        // By default blocks [".css", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".svg", ".gif", ".woff", ".pdf", ".zip"]
        await blockRequests();
    },
],
```

As you can see, the pre-navigation hook is blocking requests for PDF files along with other file types. If you want to enable downloading of PDF files during web scraping, you would need to modify this code to remove the `.pdf` entry from the list of blocked file types.


#### can it be run offline using crawlee without apify  

No, the provided code relies on the Apify SDK and the PlaywrightCrawler class, which are part of the Apify platform. The Apify SDK provides a set of tools and utilities for web scraping, data extraction, and automation. The PlaywrightCrawler class is a specific implementation of a web crawler that uses the Playwright library for browser automation.

If you want to run the code offline without using Apify, you would need to replace the Apify SDK and PlaywrightCrawler with alternative libraries or frameworks that provide similar functionality. You would also need to modify the code to work with the new libraries and adapt any Apify-specific features or functionalities.

Keep in mind that the Apify platform offers many useful features and services for web scraping, such as automatic proxy rotation, request queuing, and data storage. If you choose to run the code offline, you may need to implement these features yourself or find alternative solutions.
